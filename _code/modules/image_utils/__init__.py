Three main entrypoints:
1. ImageLoader - Load/copy/resize images with metadata
2. ImageOCR (in ocr_utils) - Run OCR with resize tracking
3. ImageOverlay - Overlay text/graphics from OCR or manual input

"""Lightweight utilities for loading, copying and resizing a single image.

This subpackage provides a simple API for loading an image from disk and
optionally copying it to a target directory and/or resizing it.  It can
persist metadata about the operation.  It does not depend on any
crawling infrastructure and is designed to be used as a standalone
component after an image has been downloaded.

Exports:
    ImageLoaderPolicy: Pydantic model describing how to load/copy/resize
        an image and control metadata output.
    ImageLoader: runner class that performs the load/copy/resize and writes
        metadata.  Uses :mod:`fso_utils` to build safe file paths and
        :mod:`log_utils` to emit logs.
